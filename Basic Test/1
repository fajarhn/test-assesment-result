The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) gives structure to the challenges of transitioning from the beginning to the end of your project without forgetting a step. 
Here are the key pros and cons of six of the most common SDLC methodologies :

Waterfall Model, V-Shaped Model, Iterative Model, Spiral Model, Big Bang Model, Agile Model.
In my opinion, the best SDLC model is the Spiral model because One of the most flexible SDLC methodologies, the Spiral model takes a cue from the Iterative model and 
its repetition; the project passes through four phases over and over in a "spiral" until completed, allowing for multiple rounds of refinement.
This model allows for the building of a highly customized product, and user feedback can be incorporated from early on in the project
